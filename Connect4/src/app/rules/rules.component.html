        <h3>Rules of the game :</h3>
        <h4>The goal of the game is to line up a series of 4 pawns of the same color on a grid with 6 rows and 7 columns. <br><br>

            Each player has 21 pawns of one color (by convention, usually yellow or red).<br> Alternately, the two players place a pawn in the column of their choice, the pawn then slides to the lowest possible position in the said column. <br><br>
            
            The winner is the player who first achieves a consecutive alignment (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) of at least four pawns of his color. <br> If, while all the squares of the game grid are filled, neither of the two players has made such an alignment, the game end in a tie.</h4>
